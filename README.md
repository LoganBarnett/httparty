# httparty

Makes http fun again!  Ain't no party like a httparty, because a httparty don't stop.

## Install

```
gem install httparty
```

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.0.0 or higher
* multi_xml
* You like to party!

## Examples

```ruby
# Use the class methods to get down to business quickly
response = HTTParty.get('http://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?site=stackoverflow')

puts response.body, response.code, response.message, response.headers.inspect

# Or wrap things up in your own class
class StackExchange
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'api.stackexchange.com'

  def initialize(service, page)
    @options = { query: { site: service, page: page } }
  end

  def questions
    self.class.get("/2.2/questions", @options)
  end

  def users
    self.class.get("/2.2/users", @options)
  end
end

stack_exchange = StackExchange.new("stackoverflow", 1)
puts stack_exchange.questions
puts stack_exchange.users
```

See the [examples directory](http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree/master/examples) for even more goodies.

## Command Line Interface

httparty also includes the executable `httparty` which can be
used to query web services and examine the resulting output. By default
it will output the response as a pretty-printed Ruby object (useful for
grokking the structure of output). This can also be overridden to output
formatted XML or JSON. Execute `httparty --help` for all the
options. Below is an example of how easy it is.

```
httparty "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?site=stackoverflow"
```

### Options

HTTParty provides lots of options for customization.

##### Request Options

- `:body` - Body of the request. If passed an object that responds to `#to_hash`, will try to normalize it first, by default passing it to `HTTParty::HashConversions.to_params`. Any other kind of object will get used as-is.
- `:http_proxyaddr` - Address of proxy server to use.
- `:http_proxyport` -  Port of proxy server to use.
- `:http_proxyuser` - User for proxy server authentication.
- `:http_proxypass` - Password for proxy server authentication.
- `:limit` - Maximum number of redirects to follow. Takes precedences over `:no_follow`.
- `:query` - Query string, or an object that responds to `#to_hash` representing it. Normalized according to the same rules as `:body`. If you specify this on a POST, you must use an object which responds to `#to_hash`. See also `HTTParty::ClassMethods.default_params`.
- `:default_timeout` - Timeout for opening connection and reading data.
- `:open_timeout` - Timeout for opening connection.
- `:read_timeout` - Timeout for reading data.
- `:write_timeout` - Timeout for writing data.
- `:local_host` - Local address to bind to before connecting.
- `:local_port` - Local port to bind to before connecting.
- `:max_retries` - Allows to specify number of retries on unsuccessful request.
- `:body_stream` - Allow streaming to a REST server to specify a body_stream.
- `:stream_body` - Allow for streaming large files without loading them into memory.
- `:multipart` - Force content-type to be multipart.
- `:raise_on` - Raises `HTTParty::ResponseError` if response's code matches this statuses.

#### Request and Class Options
There are also another set of options with names corresponding to various class methods. The methods in question are those that let you set a class-wide default, and the options override the defaults on a request-by-request basis. Those options are:

- `:base_uri` -- Allows setting a base uri to be used for each request. Will normalize uri to include http, etc.
- `:basic_auth` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.basic_auth`. Only one of `:basic_auth` and `:digest_auth` can be used at a time; if you try using both, you'll get an `ArgumentError`.
- `:digest_auth` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.digest_auth`. Only one of `:basic_auth` and `:digest_auth` can be used at a time; if you try using both, you'll get an `ArgumentError`.
- `:debug_output` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.debug_output`.
- `:format` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.format`.
- `:headers` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.headers`. Must be a an object which responds to `#to_hash`.
- `:maintain_method_across_redirects` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.maintain_method_across_redirects`.
- `:no_follow` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.no_follow`.
- `:parser` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.parser`.
- `:uri_adapter` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.uri_adapter`
- `:connection_adapter` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.connection_adapter`.
- `:pem` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.pem`.
- `:query_string_normalizer` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.query_string_normalizer`.
- `:ssl_ca_file` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.ssl_ca_file`.
- `:ssl_ca_path` -- See `HTTParty::ClassMethods.ssl_ca_path`.


### Parsing JSON
If the response Content Type is `application/json`, HTTParty will parse the response and return Ruby objects such as a hash or array. The default behavior for parsing JSON will return keys as strings. This can be supressed with the `format` option. To get hash keys as symbols:

```ruby
response = HTTParty.get('http://example.com', format: :plain)
JSON.parse response, symbolize_names: true
```

### Multipart

If you are uploading file in params, multipart will used as content-type automatically
```ruby
HTTParty.post(
  'http://localhost:3000/user',
  body: {
    name: 'Foo Bar',
    email: 'example@email.com',
    avatar: File.open('/full/path/to/avatar.jpg')
  }
)
```

However, you can force it yourself with `:multipart` option
```ruby
HTTParty.post(
  'http://localhost:3000/user',
  multipart: true,
  body: {
    name: 'Foo Bar',
    email: 'example@email.com'
  }
)
```


### Working with SSL

You can use this guide to work with SSL certificates.

##### Using `pem` option

```ruby
# Use this example if you are using a pem file

class Client
  include HTTParty

  base_uri "https://example.com"
  pem File.read("#{File.expand_path('.')}/path/to/certs/cert.pem"), "123456"
end
```

##### Using `pkcs12` option

```ruby
# Use this example if you are using a pkcs12 file

class Client
  include HTTParty

  base_uri "https://example.com"
  pkcs12 File.read("#{File.expand_path('.')}/path/to/certs/cert.p12"), "123456"
end
```

##### Using `ssl_ca_file` option

```ruby
# Use this example if you are using a pkcs12 file

class Client
  include HTTParty

  base_uri "https://example.com"
  ssl_ca_file "#{File.expand_path('.')}/path/to/certs/cert.pem"
end
```

##### Using `ssl_ca_path` option

```ruby
# Use this example if you are using a pkcs12 file

class Client
  include HTTParty

  base_uri "https://example.com"
  ssl_ca_path '/path/to/certs'
end
```

You can also include this options with the call:

```ruby
class Client
  include HTTParty

  base_uri "https://example.com"

  def self.fetch
    get("/resources", pem: (File.read("#{File.expand_path('.')}/path/to/certs/cert.pem"), "123456")
  end
end
```

#### Avoid SSL verification

In some cases you may want to skip SSL verification, because the entity that issue the certificate is not a valid one, but you still want to work with it. You can achieve this through:

```ruby
# Skips SSL certificate verification

class Client
  include HTTParty

  base_uri "https://example.com"
  pem File.read("#{File.expand_path('.')}/path/to/certs/cert.pem"), "123456"

  def self.fetch
    get("/resources", verify: false)
    # You can also use something like:
    # get("resources", verify_peer: false)
  end
end
```

## Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Run `bundle`
* Run `bundle exec rake`
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Run `bundle exec rake` (No, REALLY :))
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
